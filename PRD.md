# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Name (Working Title): **VibeCoders IDE**

### One-liner:

An AI-powered IDE that simulates a real-world software development process: the user acts as a project manager and the AI acts as a developer, guiding from idea to planning to fully coded, scalable full-stack applications.

---

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Description:

VibeCoders IDE is an interactive platform that allows beginners or aspiring developers to experience real-world software engineering workflows. Before any coding begins, the user provides a project idea. The AI acts like a developer, generating detailed planning materials — HLD (High-Level Design), LLD (Low-Level Design), system architecture, data flow diagrams, tech stack recommendations, scalability, and security strategies. Once the user (playing the role of a project manager) approves the plan, the AI begins coding within an integrated IDE.

### 1.2 Objectives:

* Teach users the real process of full-stack development, not just coding.
* Simulate the interaction between project managers and developers.
* Generate well-structured, scalable, and secure applications.
* Provide full mentorship from idea to deployment in the simplest form.

### 1.3 Differentiators:

* Planning-first approach (unlike Replit or Cursor).
* Real-life team simulation: Manager (user) → Developer (AI).
* Beginner-friendly system design breakdowns.
* Emphasis on scalability and real-world practices.

## 2. Target Users

### 2.1 User Personas:

* **Vibe Coders:** Curious new coders who want to build real-world apps without being overwhelmed.
* **Beginner Developers:** Bootcamp students or college learners trying to understand system design.
* **Solo Builders:** Early-stage indie hackers who need planning help.
* **Career Switchers:** Professionals from non-tech backgrounds moving into development.

### 2.2 Pain Points:

* Don’t know how to plan a real-world project.
* Struggle with folder structure, scalability, DB design.
* Want to understand developer workflows used in tech companies.
* Need mentorship-like guidance to gain confidence.

---

## 3. Problem Statement

While many platforms help with code generation (e.g., Replit, GitHub Copilot), none guide users through the **entire development workflow** used in real-world tech companies:

* Planning → Design → Architecture → Approval → Implementation → Testing → Deployment.

Beginners skip planning and make bad architecture choices.
There's no safe environment to simulate a full software development life cycle.

**Outcome desired:**
A user can confidently take an idea, understand how to plan it like a real developer, build it with help from an AI agent, and deploy a secure, scalable full-stack app.
